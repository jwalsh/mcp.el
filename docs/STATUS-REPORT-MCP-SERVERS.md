# MCP Servers Integration Status Report

**Date:** March 6, 2025  
**Status:** Work in Progress  
**Author:** Jason Walsh

## Overview

This status report details the development of MCP server integration components for both Claude Desktop and Emacs environments. The goal is to create a unified approach to managing MCP servers that works seamlessly in both environments.

## Completed Components

1. **Validation Script (`sjg-evaluate-claude-desktop.sh`)**
   - Standalone bash script to validate MCP server configuration
   - Automatically checks dependencies (npx, uvx, jq)
   - Tests all configured MCP servers
   - Uses JSON-RPC to list available tools from each server
   - Offers to deploy configuration to Claude Desktop
   - Published as a gist: https://gist.github.com/jwalsh/e114c882bade5d662a9a7eac8fa5b109

2. **Emacs Integration (`mcp-servers.el`)**
   - Complete package for managing MCP servers from Emacs
   - Auto-detects configuration files in standard locations
   - Manages server processes and connections
   - Provides interface for listing and calling MCP tools
   - Includes global minor mode with keybindings

3. **Example Configuration (`examples/mcp-servers-example.el`)**
   - Example setup for using MCP servers in Emacs
   - Demonstrates QR code generation, filesystem browsing, and git integration
   - Includes help documentation and keybindings

4. **Documentation**
   - README-MCP-SERVERS.md with installation and usage instructions
   - This status report
   - Inline code documentation

## Current Status

All core components are functional but require further testing. The system supports the following MCP servers:

- Filesystem server (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`)
- Git server (`mcp-server-git`)
- Memory server (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`)
- QR code server (`@jwalsh/mcp-server-qrcode`)
- Sequential thinking server (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking`)
- Puppeteer server (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer`)

## Next Steps

1. **Testing & Validation**
   - Cross-platform testing (macOS, Linux, FreeBSD)
   - Test with all supported MCP servers
   - Verify JSON-RPC tool listing and calling functionality

2. **Additional Features**
   - Integration with Emacs org-babel for MCP tool execution
   - UI improvements for browsing available tools
   - More example functions for common server types
   - Support for server-specific environment variables

3. **Documentation**
   - Tutorial for creating new MCP server configurations
   - Example workflows for common use cases
   - Update main README to mention these new components

## Technical Challenges

- Handling authentication for servers that require it
- Managing environment variables securely
- Ensuring proper process management across platforms
- Supporting different versions of MCP servers

## Conclusion

The MCP server integration project has made significant progress, with functional components for both standalone validation and Emacs integration. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for further development and testing.

With these components, users can validate their MCP server configurations, manage servers from Emacs, and interact with MCP tools through a consistent interface. The next phase will focus on testing, documentation, and additional features to enhance the user experience.
