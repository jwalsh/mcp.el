# MCP Server Test Prompts

## Filesystem Server Tests

1. What files are in my Documents directory?
2. Show me the content of the README file in my current project.
3. Find all JavaScript files in my projects directory.
4. What's the size of the largest file in my Documents folder?
5. When was the last time I modified files in my projects directory?

## Git Server Tests

6. What branches exist in this repository?
7. Show me the last 5 commits in this repository.
8. What files have changed in my working directory?
9. Who are the top contributors to this repository?
10. What was the commit message for the most recent commit?

## GitHub Server Tests

11. List my GitHub repositories.
12. Show me the open issues in my repository [your-repo-name].
13. What pull requests are currently open in [your-repo-name]?
14. Show me the README file from [your-repo-name].
15. When was the last time someone contributed to [your-repo-name]?

## Memory Server Tests

16. Remember that my favorite programming language is Emacs Lisp.
17. What is my favorite programming language?
18. Remember that I'm working on a project called MCP.el that connects Claude to Emacs.
19. What project am I working on?
20. What can you tell me about the MCP.el project I mentioned earlier?

## Sequential Thinking Server Tests

21. Use sequential thinking to solve this complex problem: How would you implement a caching layer for MCP server responses?
22. Break down the process of creating a new MCP server implementation into detailed steps.
23. Use sequential thinking to analyze the pros and cons of different approaches to error handling in MCP servers.
24. Step by step, explain how the authentication flow works between Claude Desktop and GitHub.
25. Think through how you would design a testing framework for MCP servers.

## Combined Server Tests

26. Find all Git repositories in my projects directory and show me their latest commits.
27. Remember that I use GitHub for my open source projects. What repositories do I maintain?
28. Show me the README of my most recently updated GitHub repository.
29. Compare the structure of files in my current project with a similar project in my GitHub repositories.
30. Using sequential thinking, analyze the most common patterns in my code across projects in both local files and GitHub repositories.
